  title: Welcome to Great Falls Volunteer Fire Department
  subtitle: Station 12, Great Falls, Virginia
  description: >
    We're celebrating our 75th year of service to the community!   We welcome you to the website of the Great Falls Volunteer Fire Department. Check back here often for news about our organization, fire safety information, and community events. We have been serving the community since 1942 and welcome your interest.
    
    The new station officially opened on 10 March 2012. The County officially opened the station to the public in a ceremony honoring all those who made the new station possible. A heart felt thank you to all those in the community who have supported the fire department and for those who donated to the new station. The new station is the end point of a long journey!  We have been certified as a LEEDS Gold building with all of the green technologies that were used in its construction. This is the first County building to meet this standard.  We were lucky we had a fantastic builder that completed the work in record time.

    With the generosity of the donations of the community we have been able to purchase another ambulance. It is a Ford 4x4 chassis built by Braun. This will be the new frontline unit and the current ambulance has become a reserve to be used by the volunteers. The Great Falls VFD is the ONLY department in Fairfax County to have four wheel drive ambulances.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
